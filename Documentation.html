        A modern browser, a modern device, and a stable internet connection are
        required to use the Q2 Accessibility Checker. The software uses data from
        external sources, which requires an internet connection to fetch. Users can
        utilize keyboard, mouse, and touch navigation to interact with the page.

        Background Statistics:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Having an accessible webpage is important to ensure that users of all types
        and abilities can interact with its features. Accessibility features
        benefit both those with and without disabilities through alternative
        methods of using the page. According to W3.org, more than fifteen percent
        of all people in the world have a recognized disability. In a W3 case study
        of the addition of text alternative transcripts to NPR, search traffic
        increased by 6.86%. The WebAIM Million report in February 2021 showed the
        rate of failure of the top one million websites at 97.4%. This mean that
        only 2.6% of these websites can pass the WebAIM accessibility test without
        returning any errors.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What Accessibility Checker Can do to Help:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Accessibility Checker will scan webpages to make sure that web pages are
        inclusive for people and devices of all types and backgrounds. This
        software is for employees at Q2 and their customers, to easily run
        accessibility checks for a webpage, across multiple APIs at the same time.
        Checking with multiple APIs decreases the presence of bias from a singular
        API test and points out errors from more than one perspective. The software
        also allows for manual review between the different APIs to check for false
        positive results. Symbols and warnings are listed on the page where manual
        attention is especially necessary, such as contrast errors and duplicate
        IDs that the APIs find. Creating issues on Jira project boards is also
        encouraged with buttons to start an issue on each WCAG result under the
        Pa11y API.

        An Example Usage:
      </h2>
      <p>
        A team who developed a webpage which is located at <em>q2.com</em> wants to
        check the accessibility of the page using multiple APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user enters the desired URL on the main page and clicks the submit
        button:
      </p>

        <img
          width="50%"
          src="/images/Front Page.png"
          alt="Front Page"
        />

      <p>
        The user is presented with the initial results screen.
      </p>

        <img
          width="50%"
          src="/images/Results Page.png"
          alt="Results Page"
        />

      <p>
        The dashboard appears at the top, with an overview and total amounts of
        errors from some of the included APIs. The Overview section can be expanded to view basic statistics.
      </p>

        <img
          width="50%"
          src="/images/Overview.png"
        />

      <p>
        The WebAIM WAVE API will provide types of features and errors grouped into
        categories, along with the locations of each instance. Categories involving
        severity type are also colored to match the accessibility level of the
        issue, where orange represents low accessibility, yellow represents
        improvements, and green represents a section that is highly accessible. All
        instances listed begin at the either the first ID value, or the first
        element if no IDs are used on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          width="50%"
          src="/images/Webaim.png"
        />
        <img
          width="50%"
          src="/images/Instances.png"
          alt="Graphical user interface, text, application
      
      Description automatically generated"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        The screenshot above shows an open accordion for the errors category and
        the first type of error with its instances. The errors accordion is orange,
        showing that there were several errors found on the page. The API counted
        six places where alternative text may be missing from an important part of
        the page, and lists the location for each time this occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pa11y API will list varieties of errors and suggestions based on the
        WCAG Guidelines, Version 2.1. Error headers will display the number of the
        error, the principle and guideline, and what the guideline represents.
        Inside each expanded error, details including a definition and a location
        will also appear. For special instances where manual review and user
        attention is especially necessary, an icon will appear next to the error.
        These include duplicate ID errors, submit button errors, and contrast
        errors. Duplicate ID and contrast errors will also display the name of the
        ID and the recommended color, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        (In development) An option to create a Jira Issue for each error will also
        appear at the bottom of each error, making it easier to add relevant errors
        and suggestions to your project board.
      </p>

        <img
          width="317"
          height="337"
          src="/images/Pa11yTest.png"
        />

      <p>
        In this screenshot, a violation of WCAG Guideline 1.4 was found, involving
        contrast. A contrast icon and a recommended color appear, alongside the
        definition, a path, and a Jira button.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the A11y API, the user can view the results from a series of simple
        pass/fail tests if they apply to what is included within the content of the
        page. The results are pulled from a JSON file automatically created by the
        API. A button for help regarding each of the tests is also provided,
        alongside the level of severity of a failing result in each category.
      </p>

        <img
          width="50%"
          src="/images/A11yTests.png"
        />

      <p>
        In the above screenshot, the page passed two of the tests shown, and one
        did not apply. Each test has its own severity level and a help button,
        linking to a location in the A11y API Documentation page about each test
        and how to ensure the page passes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Puppeteer API will take a screenshot of the provided page in two
        different views. These include a mobile phone view, and a desktop computer
        view, which will be printed to the results screen. In an instance where the
        API takes too long to load the image and a different image is displayed, a
        reload button appears at the top of the section. Clicking this button will
        reload the images with a new timestamp, allowing the most recent image file
        to appear and replace the old image.
      </p>

        <img
          width="50%"
          src="/images/PuppeteerAPI.png"
        />

      <p>
        In this screenshot, a mobile and desktop view of the page appear alongside
        the reload button at the top. These allow the user to understand if the
        page is responsive and able to be re-scaled.
